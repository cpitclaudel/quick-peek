;;; Commentary:

;; A utility library to display inline pop-ups.  Looks roughly like this:
;;
;;
;; let _ = <|>le m n                           ← <|> marks the point
;; ------------------------------------------- ← Pop-up begins here
;;         le : ℕ → ℕ → ℙ
;;         Inductive le (n : ℕ) : ℕ → ℙ ≜
;;         | le_n : n ≤ n
;;         | le_S : ∀ m : ℕ, n ≤ m → n ≤ S m
;; ------------------------------------------- ← Pop-up ends here
;;         && le n m                           ← Buffer text continues here
;;
;; See `quick-peek-show' and `quick-peek-hide' for usage instructions.
